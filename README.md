# Musicvkaif
This is a mobile application for music studio students. 
Here they can see general information, for example, read about the studio's teachers or find out contact information such as address, e-mail, phone number. 

Each student is automatically logged into the system when signing up for the studio. 
Therefore, he can clarify his schedule, watch the news, and also sign up for a new lesson.
